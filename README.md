# my-game
A game I will be working on.

So, my idea for the game is a side-scrolling "ninja" game. It would have a pretty good storyline (I have one in mind) and several levels. The levels would be progressively harder, and you would have to buy upgrades for yourself using coins you earned by defeating enemies in previous levels. If you can't pass a level, you would have to re-play a level to get more coins to upgrade yourself. The "coolness" part of the game that makes it fun to play would probably rely mostly on:

1. **Cool graphics.** To make this a nice game, I can't cut back on graphics, not even for the backgrounds.

2. **Cool power-ups and abilities to buy and unlock.** Something to keep the player playing.

3. **A good story!** You get to find out more of the story only after you beat a level, so its an incentive to beat all the levels.

4. **Running and playing smoothly, no lag or glitches.** This might mean pre-loading images and other things I don't normally do.


A few things to decide on:

1. **How will the story be shown to the player between the levels?** Cutscenes, like in the Lego Batman video games?

2. **How violent is this going to be?** I was thinking that for human enemies, you can only use non-lethal weapons/punches or kicks- just things that stun them. However, you can blow up and destroy the evil robots that come for you.

3. **Finalize storyline.** (Rough storyline below.)

Storyline is currently as follows: (for lack of having a better name I'm just going to use the name Ben)
